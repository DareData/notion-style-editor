## Project Requirements:

- The editor accepts markdown and outputs markdown.
- It is a react component that works within our ecosystem (next.js, chakra-ui) and renders in `pages/index.tsx`
- You have 3 weeks from start to finish.
- You have daily communication with Sam (project manager) and the designers.
- It would be preferable to select an external library so that we don't have to maintain a complex codebase.
- You will have access to figma designs.

## Additional information:

- We are very flexible and the designers are more than willing to compromise.
- The 3 week deadline in which we achieve a smooth experience that is markdown based
  is more important than delivering EXACTLY what is designed.
- We have identified the [milkdown](https://milkdown.dev/) editor as a potential candidate.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
